                        Margots has a surprising sense of taste. He can take notions such as "I like textures" and
                        "I like deep colour with contrasts" and come up with a firm starting place for a website.
                        Changing minute details in the site is never a problem. He is well versed in the possibilities
                        for websites and builds your site with the technologies that fit what you want it to be able to do.
                        My website, although new, comes up much higher in Google searches than I expected because Margots
                        built it with that in mind ("clean", he says) and made sure that I followed through with
                        keywords and optimization. He is always available to me to answer technical questions and seems
                        genuinely invested in my website's and my business' success.

                        When we needed a new web page we went to Margots at kapasoft.com because we needed someone
                        who understood our needs, was willing to work with all of the different groups at our church,
                        and also had the design and technical smarts that we lacked.  Margots design met all of our
                        visual needs, was easy to maintain, and could be easily modified or changed by our people.
                        Margots also provided the kind of help and training for our members that made our new web
                        page an ever-changing resource for our congregation that everyone now points to with pride.
